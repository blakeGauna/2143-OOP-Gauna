### Description:

This program creates the appropriate number of characters based on the input  and proceeds to manage battles between attackers and defenders choosing the appropriate character to fight based on the above rules. It uses run time polymorphism to switch between attacking characters and defending characters. When the attacking or defending queues become empty, the battle is over and the side with characters remaining wins.
