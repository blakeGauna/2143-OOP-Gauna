### Blake Gauna
### Description:

This is a UML diagram for a student. The student exists on its own with all the variables that it needs. The Schedule is composed of a student because it wouldn't exist without being assigned to a student. The grades are composed of the schedule becasue the schedule already contains the courses, subject, and necessary info for grades to exist. The GPA is composed of the grades. The final transcript is composed of everything before it.
